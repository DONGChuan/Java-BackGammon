BackGammon Java
=================

[BackGammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon) is one of the oldest board games known. This project is to realize this game by Java.

In fact, the original purpose of this project is for courses of my school [Telecom Saint Etienne](https://www.telecom-st-etienne.fr/). We are required to make this project during 5 days by a team of four. This project is a summary of many other courses: Java, Design Patterns, Project Management, etc.

The main points in this project:
* Java
* Swing
* MVC
* XML
* JUnit
